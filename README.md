**Catalyst Project Overview**

Catalyst is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), designed to provide a transparent, secure, and user-centric solution for community-driven funding. It empowers users to propose, vote on, and manage projects, ensuring full visibility and tamper-proof records using blockchain technology. The platform integrates Internet Identity for secure user authentication and the Plug wallet for seamless transaction management. Catalyst's architecture is powered by Motoko and React, creating a smooth and intuitive experience for users while maintaining the decentralized nature of the platform. 

**Tech Stack:**
- **Blockchain Platform**: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)
- **Backend**: Motoko (smart contract logic and data handling)
- **Frontend**: React (responsive and user-friendly interface)
- **Authentication**: Internet Identity (secure user login)
- **Wallet Integration**: Plug wallet (transaction management)
- **Data Management**: Ledger and Index canisters (secure transaction tracking)

**ReadMe:**
Catalyst is built to overcome the limitations of traditional crowdfunding, such as high fees, centralization, and lack of transparency. With a focus on community governance, it enables users to track the flow of funds and participate in decision-making processes through a secure, decentralized platform. The development process emphasized seamless integration among React, Motoko, and ICP, ensuring a user-centric and scalable solution. The platform's design is geared towards future growth, including token creation, partnerships, global expansion, and continuous feature enhancements based on user feedback.

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd icpTransfer/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
